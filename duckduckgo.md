## Instant Answer API

An [Instant Answer API](https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=Duckduckgo&format=json) exist. [The fucking manual](https://web.archive.org/web/20220608045643/https://api.duckduckgo.com/api) has gone and I don't know why it still exist. Probably because someone still use them and Duckduckgo just simply can't let it go.
