The Code.JSON here lists all projects the US departments provided. But most of items are not APIs I am interested. Merely check if they are still under maintaince or not makes me tired.

For example, the API from the [Department of State](https://state.gov) is <https://www.state.gov/code.json>:

```json
{
    "version":"1.0.3",
    "agency": "DOS",
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "BIDS",
            "organization": "Department of State, Information Resource Management's Office of eDiplomacy",
            "description": "Business Information Database System",
            "license": null,
            "openSourceProject": 0,
            "governmentWideReuseProject": 1,
            "tags": [
                "Department of State",
                "DOS",
                "eDiplomacy",
                "EB",
                "Economic Bureau",
                "Econ Bureau",
                "Business Opportunities",
                "Geoviz",
                "Map",
                "Geovisualization",
                "Data",
                "Leaflet",
                "Node",
                "Nodejs",
                "JavaScript"
            ],
            "contact": {
                "email": "ediplomacy@state.gov",
                "name": "Tim Hayes",
                "URL": "https://www.state.gov/m/irm/ediplomacy/"
            },
            "status": "Beta",
            "vcs": "git",
            "repository": "https://github.com/USStateDept/BIDS",
            "homepage": "https://bids.state.gov/",
            "languages": [
                "JavaScript",
                "HTML",
                "CSS"
            ],
            "partners": [],
            "updated": {
                "metadataLastUpdated": "2017-03-02"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

So the Department of State, only provided the `BIDS` project. And guess what, the repository is NOT exist anymore.

I don't get the point of the site currently. Seriously.
